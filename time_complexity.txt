constructor
	n = number of words in the dictionary file
	worst case: O(n);
	best case: O(n);
	
Pre-processing to process old text
	n = number of words in the old text file
	worst case: n log n (where the log n is on the scale of log n but is actually much smaller, close to log ( n/26) (on average))
	best case: same thing
	
Guessing
	n = number of words in the new text file
	m = number of characters per word
	worst and best case are both n * m * log(n), with log n having the same property as above
	
Feedback
	n = number of words in the new text file
	m = number of characters per word
	best case: every word is guessed after the first letter
		O(1) time
	worst case: every word is never guessed
		O(n * log(n)), with log n having the same property as above
